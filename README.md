Conformity
==========

Conformity takes the complexity out of forms validation and allows for complete configurability of form elements without any additional controller or view logic.  Define form elements in the data model and Conformity handles the rest. 

ConformitySQL - Sql Scripts to install conormity tables and remote data procedures.
